# Configure SmartDock through its CLI

**Unreleased CLI-first candidate.** These commands describe this source candidate, not every installed SmartDock release. Use the running host's schema as the capability authority. Configuration is CLI-only: the former Settings page and temporary preference previews are removed; ordinary window previews, the app picker, menus, drag reordering, workspace/window actions, auto-hide and Trash remain.

Never edit a deployed checkout, scrape the UI, launch a second dock, restart Omarchy, install a provider, change desktop/theme files, or silently fall back to raw `dock.json` writes for configuration. A missing command in an older host is a compatibility/unsupported-feature result, not permission to bypass its writer. Source work is appropriate only for an explicitly requested unsupported feature or an evidenced defect, in a source branch under its owning issue.

## Five-step change workflow

1. **Discover the host and current state.** Use status/doctor/schema/get below. Stop on ambiguous or incompatible targeting; use an exact discovered instance. Read `data.configPath`, not a path inferred from the working directory or client environment.
2. **Limit the intended keys or identities.** Read the relevant schema and requested/effective values. Preserve unknown keys, pins, hidden membership, artwork and compatible legacy values. Do not turn a narrow request into a preference reset or whole-array replacement.
3. **Export to a new backup, then dry-run a minimal patch.** Record original touched values and the desired new values. A backup is a reference snapshot, not a later whole-file restore command.
4. **Apply once through the CLI.** Apply the same payload only after inspecting its diff. The host recomputes against latest state; the dry run is not a lock. Keep explicit selectors on every command.
5. **Read back and report the outcome.** Compare requested and effective values, inspect `applied`, `persisted`, `writeState`, errors and warnings. Restore only touched values after fresh readback when rollback is requested. Do not overwrite intervening edits blindly.

```sh
smartdock status --json
smartdock doctor --json
smartdock config schema --json
smartdock config get --json
smartdock config get hoverGlowOpacity --effective --json
```

When needed, append `--runtime plugin` or `--runtime standalone` and `--instance ID` using an actual returned ID, not a placeholder. Global control options work before or after the command. `runtime.instanceId` is the process ID for this host lifetime; `runtime.quickshellId` is the native qs ID. Both are exact selectors. Rediscover after restarts. The client never picks the newest instance. Changing `SMARTDOCK_CONFIG` or XDG variables in the client does not retarget a running host.

Bare `smartdock`, `help` and `agent-guide` work offline and create no directories. Automatic `config schema` may return `source: bundled` only when no matching host exists, never for explicit-target failures, ambiguity or malformed protocol. Bundled metadata is not the user's settings. All mutations and exports require a host.

## Backup and apply a related patch

The following example changes placement, size, visibility and Trash together; use it only when those changes are intended. Save the JSON block to a new `patch.json` under the private change directory, or supply the same bytes through explicit `--stdin`.

```sh
umask 077
change_dir="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/smartdock-change.XXXXXX")"
smartdock config export --output "$change_dir/requested-before.json" --json
```

<!-- recipe: safe-batch -->
```json
{"position":"bottom","iconSize":36,"autoHide":true,"showTrash":false}
```

After placing the intended JSON in `$change_dir/patch.json`:

```sh
smartdock config apply --file "$change_dir/patch.json" --dry-run --json
smartdock config apply --file "$change_dir/patch.json" --json
smartdock config get --json
smartdock config get --effective --json
smartdock status --json
```

Inspect dry-run `data.changedKeys`, `diff`, full proposed `requested` and `effective`. Dry run has `applied: false`, `persisted: false`; it neither creates a defaults file nor increments revision. New input must be a UTF-8 JSON object, at most 64 KiB, without duplicate keys, non-finite values, unknown new keys or invalid types/ranges. One invalid value rejects the whole batch. There is no implicit stdin or offline writer.

For one key, `smartdock config set hoverGlowOpacity 0.72 --json` parses the runtime-declared type and sends a minimal patch. Booleans require lowercase true/false; strings are literal; arrays/maps are JSON and replace that key. The requested 0.72 remains 0.72 while the effective value is 0.70. Use primitive app/icon commands rather than editing an old collection snapshot.

## Tested preference recipes

Save only the desired block as a patch, then use the backup/dry-run/apply/readback workflow above. These are examples, not presets applied automatically.

### Theme-linked surface

Pair colors with enable flags. Tokens remain live; unknown renderer-resolved values do not justify replacing a token.

<!-- recipe: theme -->
```json
{"backgroundColorEnabled":true,"backgroundColor":"@menu.background","borderColorEnabled":true,"borderColor":"@accent","backgroundOpacity":0.85}
```

Colors accept empty, `#RRGGBB`, Qt `#AARRGGBB` (alpha first), or symbolic tokens. Effective token/theme colors and theme-owned border width are null with warnings because the host does not report renderer-resolved values. Disable only a paired Enabled flag to restore inheritance while retaining the stored override.

### Calmer dock motion

This changes SmartDock motion, not compositor-wide animations. The attention badge can remain static.

<!-- recipe: calmer-motion -->
```json
{"magnification":1,"hoverGlowEnabled":false,"interfaceAnimationsEnabled":false,"urgentWindowAnimationEnabled":false}
```

### Horizontal workspace cards

The example explicitly moves to the bottom; do not move a vertical dock without permission. A requested grouped layout renders flat on left/right without being erased. Grouped-card monitor scope is separate from flat running-window scope.

<!-- recipe: workspace-cards -->
```json
{"position":"bottom","workspaceLayout":"grouped","workspaceMonitorScope":"current-monitor"}
```

## Restore and order applications

First discover actual IDs and pinned/hidden membership. The block assumes the returned IDs are `code` and `org.gnome.Nautilus`, and the latter is already pinned; substitute the actual exact identities, not display names. Run only the intended operations. Pin does not show a hidden app, so explicit show is separate.

<!-- recipe: applications -->
```sh
smartdock apps list --query 'Editor' --json
smartdock apps list --pinned --json
smartdock apps list --hidden --json
smartdock apps pin code --json
smartdock apps show code --json
smartdock apps move code --before org.gnome.Nautilus --json
```

Discovery uses the host's native desktop catalog, not a new desktop-file scan. Rows include `id`, `name`, `available`, `pinned`, `hidden`, `pinnedIndex`. Query searches ID/name text; mutations match exact IDs after trimming, case folding and optional `.desktop` removal. Unsafe/sentinel/prototype-sensitive IDs are rejected. Stored spelling/order and unavailable pins/hidden IDs survive.

Membership operations are idempotent. `apps hide ID` hides without closing or unpinning; `apps unpin ID` removes pin membership without hiding running windows. `apps show --all` clears all hidden membership and needs explicit broad intent. Move needs two different pinned IDs and exactly one before/after anchor, preserving other relative order including hidden/unavailable entries. Re-read that order before an intentional rollback; do not replay an obsolete array.

## Set, refresh and restore per-app artwork

Discover the actual app ID first. The following `code` ID and relative path are examples; confirm the intended local PNG/SVG exists and belongs to the intended app. Use a stable path outside the plugin checkout. Set, reload and reset are shown together for a test sequence; reset is a deliberate removal, not a required step after setting an icon.

<!-- recipe: icons -->
```sh
smartdock icons list --json
smartdock icons set code './Pictures/My Ícone.svg' --json
smartdock icons reload code --json
smartdock icons reset code --json
```

The client resolves an ordinary relative path against its current directory; the shared host model validates absolute paths and supported local file URLs, preserving spaces/Unicode. Remote URLs, unsupported formats and invalid local URLs are rejected. Files are referenced in place, not downloaded/copied/imported; no `.desktop` or system theme edits occur. Shell expansion of an unquoted tilde or `$HOME` is distinct from file-URL parsing.

Set/reset updates only one canonical key against the latest map, preserving other entries and untouched legacy values. Preference reset preserves `iconOverrides`. Bulk map replacement validates the entire map and rejects canonical duplicates. Missing/unreadable/corrupt files retain the requested mapping and fall back: custom → original desktop icon → generic executable → bundled theme-tinted `app-window` glyph. Custom artwork is not tinted. Main icons, preview metadata and picker rows share the mapping; identity, launch commands, screenshots, grouping, badges, Trash and action glyphs do not change.

After replacing bytes at the same path, explicit reload advances the shared artwork revision without saving settings. Other mapped icons can refresh too. Same-source set also requests fresh bytes without a redundant settings write; repeated reset is a true no-op. `reloaded: true` means requested, not decoded; `applied`/`noop` describe settings, so reload can report `applied: false`, `noop: true`, `reloaded: true`. Every successful icon response has `renderVerified: false`. Real cache invalidation, image decoding and multi-monitor redraw remain local qualification, not headless-test claims.

## Persistence, recovery and rollback

Requested, effective, saved and rendered are separate. Read `loadState`, `loadPending`, `writeState`, errors and `persisted`. Missing configuration does not mean defaults were saved. Invalid JSON retains last-good settings and blocks mutations; repair deliberately instead of automatically overwriting it. Revision belongs to one host lifetime.

Cooperating writes use the host's one FileView writer: disjoint patches preserve each other; latest accepted same-key intent wins. A known pending load/write is refused. Unrelated pins, icons, hidden apps, extension keys and legacy values survive narrow changes. An identical patch does not hide an existing save failure.

A persistence error exits 4 and can leave `applied: true`, `persisted: false`. Inspect status; after the actual write problem is corrected, `smartdock config retry --json` saves the complete latest live snapshot without a new settings revision. Busy/invalid state exits 6. A timeout has unknown applied/persisted outcome: read status and affected values before deciding to mutate again. No unbounded retry loops.

Export writes a new owner-only plain JSON file and never overwrites a destination, follows a destination symlink, creates missing parents or aliases the live config. `exportWritten` concerns the snapshot; `sourcePersisted` concerns the live state. An unsaved snapshot is not evidence of a saved dock. Unknown exported keys are not accepted as new patch keys. Roll back only touched supported values after checking fresh state; when a prior value is a legacy alias or an absent key, inspect schema and report any normalization/absence limitation instead of writing raw bytes or pretending exact restoration.

`config reset KEY` resets only that key. `config reset --preferences` preserves pins, hidden apps, iconOverrides, margin and unknown extensions, but resets other preferences **including `controlCommand`**. Do not use it for narrow requests. `controlCommand` is executable-on-use configuration: quote it literally and **never execute it to validate**. The launcher action may execute it later. Pointer `close` can close all grouped live windows on use. Change such settings only for explicit intent.

## Machine contract and installation

`--json` emits one object with `apiVersion: 1`, `ok`, `data`, `warnings`, and `error.code/message` on failure. Exit codes: 0 success; 2 usage/validation; 3 absent/ambiguous host; 4 persistence/export failure; 5 transport/protocol/timeout; 6 busy/invalid config. See [CLI_REFERENCE.md](CLI_REFERENCE.md) for exact fields/codes and [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for all defaults/dependencies. Both ship beside this offline guide, together with the separate [local qualification runbook](CLI_RUNTIME_CHECKS.md); installing that document does not start qualification.

```sh
bash ./install.sh --cli-only
bash ./uninstall.sh --cli-only
```

Client files live under `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/smartdock-cli`; the shared wrapper is `${XDG_BIN_HOME:-$HOME/.local/bin}/smartdock`. Client-only installation/removal does not install/start a dock, user config, autostart, agent launchers or provider. It coexists with standalone in either order; removal retains the wrapper while another bundle owns it. When both exist the wrapper prefers the client-only adapter, so refresh that bundle deliberately from the intended checkout.

The adapter uses standard-library Python and bounded argv subprocesses: `qs list --all --json` and exact `qs ipc --pid PID call -- smartdock request PAYLOAD`. It does not use the Omarchy wrapper's newest-instance selection, guess wrapper flags or implement sockets. Standalone lifecycle commands are explicit and separate, never a way to configure a plugin. Full Omarchy IPC/FileView/theme/image/monitor behavior belongs to the exact-SHA local handoff; this guide does not authorize deployment or claim those checks passed.
