# Dockrail migration contract

This is the source-controlled migration matrix for FDM-1002. It distinguishes intentional SmartDock compatibility contracts from branding leftovers.

## Pinned baseline

- Source baseline: `4db288d5991dae7989add897ee5dc56c5542feb8`
- Pinned when FDM-1002 execution began on 2026-09-25.
- Repository cutover completed on 2026-09-25 after the MIG-05 native rehearsal (FDM-1010) passed on `92430da`.
- Omarchy/Quickshell/Hyprland native revisions are recorded by MIG-05, not guessed here.

## Identifier and ownership matrix

| Identifier/state | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Product/display name | Rename to Dockrail in the branding slice. |
| `dockrail` CLI | Canonical command. |
| `smartdock` CLI | Retain as a thin compatibility entry point. |
| canonical Dockrail XDG roots | Activate only through the journaled MIG-02 migration. |
| legacy SmartDock XDG roots | Preserve as source/recovery state; never silently reset. |
| `DOCKRAIL_CONFIG` | Canonical explicit override. |
| `SMARTDOCK_CONFIG` | Retain; canonical non-empty override wins when both are set. |
| `smartdock` IPC target, `request`, apiVersion 1 | Retain unchanged. |
| `io.github.fernandodamaso.smartdock` | Retain plugin ID for this release. |
| `SmartDock.WidgetKit 1.0` | Retain; MIG-03 adds `Dockrail.WidgetKit 1.0` over the same maintained components. |
| `special:smartdock-minimized` | Retain unchanged. |
| terminal-agent desktop/application IDs | Retain stable IDs. |
| Herdr helper/provider executable names | Retain executable identities. |
| Wayland layer namespaces | Retain unchanged. |
| development recovery records/worktrees | Preserve; rebase only by explicit migration policy. |
| external widget/icon/source paths | Preserve verbatim. |
| `DockHost`, `DockModel`, `DockItem`, `dock.json` | Keep as dock-domain internals. |
| historical issues/releases/plans | Keep historical names. |

## Read-only resolver contract

`scripts/dockrail_paths.py` computes canonical and legacy roots without creating,
migrating, repairing, or deleting anything. Explicit config precedence is:
non-empty `DOCKRAIL_CONFIG`, then non-empty `SMARTDOCK_CONFIG`, then the canonical
XDG config path. An explicit missing/invalid path is authoritative and must not
fall through silently.

The migration journal/lock will live outside roots being moved under the XDG
state home in `dockrail/migrations/`. MIG-02 owns transaction/recovery and startup activation.

Read-only CLI calls, bare/help, discovery, `--cli-only`, and
`--agent-assets-only` must never initiate migration. Omarchy plugin update cannot
assume `install.sh` runs, so MIG-02 owns the single service-start bootstrap.

## Cutover gate

GitHub repository rename, canonical URL replacement, Linear project rename and
the Dockrail 3.0.0 release were gated on a real legacy plugin + standalone
upgrade rehearsal. That gate passed in MIG-05; see the MIG-06 section below.
The old GitHub name is preserved as a redirect and is not recreated as a second
repository.

## MIG-02 startup and transaction contract

Production plugin startup is service-owned. `Service.qml` owns exactly one
`DockMigrationBootstrap`; provider services are created only after that bootstrap
returns a validated ready result. `Overlay.qml` consumes the same result and
does not resolve config/data roots independently. Standalone `shell.qml` uses
the same bootstrap before creating DockHost or Herdr.

The migration coordinator is `scripts/dockrail_migrate.py`. It:

1. acquires the coordinator lock under
   `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/dockrail/migrations/`;
2. validates canonical and legacy config state without repairing either;
3. refuses a pending migration while plugin or Widget development overrides are
   active, while the Widget package lock is busy, or while a standalone writer
   has not been explicitly handed off;
4. stages config and shared `widgets/` + `providers/` on their target
   filesystems and records a source signature;
5. publishes canonical roots without overwriting established canonical state;
6. preserves recovery copies in the migration transaction directory;
7. replaces only the managed legacy config/package/provider roots with aliases
   to canonical state; and
8. marks the journal committed only after those aliases validate.

Interrupted `staged`, `published`, or `aliased` transactions are resumed
idempotently. A source change after staging blocks recovery rather than
publishing stale state. Once committed canonical state validates, later active
development does not block ordinary startup.

### Canonical roots after MIG-02

- config: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/dockrail/`
- shared/deployment data: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/dockrail/`
- client bundle: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/dockrail-cli/`
- cache: `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/dockrail/`

The stable desktop/autostart IDs, plugin ID, IPC target, minimized-workspace
name, Wayland namespaces, terminal-agent IDs, Herdr executable identities and
legacy WidgetKit import remain unchanged.

### Non-migrating paths

`install.sh --cli-only`, `--agent-assets-only`, bare/help/status/schema
discovery, and ordinary IPC reads do not invoke the migration transaction.
A CLI-only bundle may discover a pre-cutover legacy client/application bundle,
but it does not move shared state.

### Removal boundary

Standalone uninstall removes deployment-owned files from the canonical data
root but preserves shared `widgets/` and `providers/`. `--purge` refuses
to delete configuration while the Omarchy plugin (including its saved
development backup) is present. External Widget source repositories, icon
files, Git worktrees and Herdr-owned external state are never recursively
deleted by this migration.


## MIG-03 WidgetKit and package compatibility

Dockrail exposes `Dockrail.WidgetKit 1.0` as the canonical public QML module while
retaining `SmartDock.WidgetKit 1.0` for existing Widget sources. Both named module
surfaces reference the same maintained files under `components/widgets/`; they are
not independent component implementations.

New package installation and development snapshots materialize one local
`Dockrail/WidgetKit` runtime copy and rewrite either named import to that
package-relative runtime path. The rewrite preserves aliases, comments and nested
QML-relative paths. Source repositories are never modified.

Existing installed/development snapshots that already contain
`SmartDock/WidgetKit` remain valid and are not rewritten merely because the
product acquired a canonical Dockrail module name. Legacy metadata filenames,
package IDs, registry ordering and source locations remain compatibility
contracts. Both module surfaces ship in full and CLI-only bundles so source
validation and package preparation do not depend on a separate checkout.


## MIG-04 product-facing branding

Current product-facing identity is Dockrail. The manifest display name/author,
standalone desktop entry, canonical CLI help/diagnostics, installer/uninstaller
output, Widget scaffolds and active documentation use Dockrail terminology and
the `dockrail` command.

This branding pass deliberately does **not** rename compatibility contracts:
`io.github.fernandodamaso.smartdock`, the `smartdock` IPC target,
`special:smartdock-minimized`, terminal-agent/application IDs, Wayland layer
namespaces, `smartdock-herdr-helper`, `smartdock-herdr-provider`,
`SmartDock.WidgetKit 1.0`, legacy XDG aliases/recovery records, historical
plans/releases. The GitHub repository URL moved in MIG-06 (see below).

The optional launcher-badge and browser-profile installer scripts now install
their binaries under the canonical Dockrail data root so they match the MIG-02
provider consumers; executable filenames remain unchanged.


## MIG-06 repository cutover

MIG-05 (FDM-1010) qualified exact head `92430da5d18fea307ea52fc6c2012a8522b8b77d`
on Omarchy 4.0.4 / Hyprland 0.56.2: a native plugin update with dev-override
refusal and a committed migration, dev reset and minimized-window recovery across
restart, plus an isolated frozen-legacy (`5a619f4`) standalone upgrade with
injected interruption at every phase and removal-ownership checks.

The repository was then renamed in place to `fernandodamaso/dockrail`. The
old `fernandodamaso/smart-omarchy-dock` name remains a GitHub redirect and must
never be recreated. Existing plugin checkouts keep their old origin URL and
continue updating through that redirect. Upstream attribution to
`nick-friedrich/hyprland-dock` and the fork relationship are unchanged. The
repository had no GitHub Pages site or external Actions consumers to migrate.
Local checkout paths such as `/home/admin/Projects/smart-omarchy-dock` were not
moved.

Current installation examples use `https://github.com/fernandodamaso/dockrail.git`.
The plugin ID remains `io.github.fernandodamaso.smartdock` because it names the
installed plugin directory and marketplace identity; renaming it would orphan
existing installs.
