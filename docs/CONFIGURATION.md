# SmartDock configuration inventory

**Unreleased CLI-first candidate.** Discover `smartdock config schema --json` on the selected running host before changing it. Its keyed metadata and `config/dock.json` are the runtime/default authorities; this table is a tested reference, not a second settings engine or a replacement for the user's configuration.

Use [the agent workflow](AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md) for minimal, reversible changes and [the CLI reference](CLI_REFERENCE.md) for command/output/error details. CLI preferences and icons replace the removed Settings page; ordinary dock menus, app picker and window previews remain.

## All declared settings

Defaults below are JSON literals. `tests/test_cli_docs.py` checks these 55 rows against the shipped defaults. Bounds apply to new CLI writes; compatible legacy requested values survive unrelated changes. There is no automatic whole-file migration.

| Key | Declared default | New-write type, limits and dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `iconOverrides` | `{}` | Object mapping canonical app IDs to local PNG/SVG sources; prefer per-app intents. Preserved by preference reset. |
| `windowIconOverrides` | `[]` | Ordered normalized raw-Wayland app ID/title-pattern rules for local PNG/SVG artwork; first match wins. Preserved by preference reset. |
| `iconSize` | `42` | Integer 24–96 logical pixels. |
| `magnification` | `1.2` | Number 1–2; effective step 0.05. Set 1 for no hover enlargement. |
| `magnificationRadius` | `95` | Number 40–240; effective step 5. |
| `hoverGlowEnabled` | `true` | Boolean; gates the hover glow. |
| `hoverGlowOpacity` | `0.72` | Number 0–1; effective step 0.05. |
| `hoverGlowRadius` | `28` | Number 0–100; effective step 5; relevant when glow is enabled. |
| `showPreviews` | `true` | Boolean; permits ordinary grouped-window previews and the previews pointer action. |
| `showTrash` | `true` | Boolean; false removes Trash and pauses its polling, never empties it. |
| `margin` | `10` | Nonnegative integer, no arbitrary maximum; preserved by preference reset. |
| `backgroundOpacity` | `0.88` | Number 0–1; effective step 0.05; multiplies background color alpha. |
| `backgroundColorEnabled` | `false` | Boolean; enables the paired background override. |
| `backgroundColor` | `""` | Color string; requires backgroundColorEnabled. |
| `borderColorEnabled` | `false` | Boolean; enables the paired border override. |
| `borderColor` | `""` | Color string; requires borderColorEnabled. |
| `workspaceBadgeBackgroundColorEnabled` | `false` | Boolean; enables the paired workspace-number badge background override. |
| `workspaceBadgeBackgroundColor` | `""` | Color string; requires workspaceBadgeBackgroundColorEnabled. |
| `workspaceBadgeTextColorEnabled` | `false` | Boolean; enables the paired workspace-number badge text override. |
| `workspaceBadgeTextColor` | `""` | Color string; requires workspaceBadgeTextColorEnabled. |
| `borderWidthEnabled` | `false` | Boolean; enables a fixed width instead of theme-owned widths. |
| `borderWidth` | `2` | Integer 0–8 logical pixels; relevant only with borderWidthEnabled. |
| `presentationMode` | `"classic"` | Classic bottom dock or mirrored sidebar panels (the dock's vertical presentation). Drag empty dock background left to switch to the sidebar, or empty sidebar background down to return. |
| `sidebarEdge` | `"left"` | Sidebar panel edge; leaves classic position unchanged. |
| `sidebarMonitor` | `""` | Empty maps a mirrored panel on every connected screen. A connected connector maps only that output. Disconnected preferences are retained and fall back to all connected screens; control characters are rejected. |
| `sidebarExpandedWidth` | `320` | Requested expanded width in logical pixels. Runtime screen clamping never overwrites this preference; a changed resize release persists only this field. |
| `sidebarCollapsed` | `false` | Default icon rail for monitors without a `sidebarCollapsedByMonitor` override. Expanded width and session app folds are retained. |
| `sidebarCollapsedByMonitor` | `{}` | Object map of exact connector → boolean. Missing connectors follow `sidebarCollapsed`. Disconnected names retained; control characters and non-booleans rejected. |
| `sidebarWidgets` | `[]` | Ordered unique registered internal widget IDs. The array is both enabled state and card order. Runtime schema advertises source-registered IDs; unknown imports remain requested/unavailable. Add/remove/reorder use the host writer. |
| `sidebarWidgetCollapsed` | `{}` | Valid internal widget ID → boolean card-body state. Missing means expanded. Removing a widget keeps its collapse preference so re-adding restores it. Preference reset clears the map. |
| `sidebarBrowserTabsEnabled` | `true` | When true and the browser-profile provider is available, sidebar Chrome window rows can expand to list open page tabs (titles only, no URLs). Independent of `browserActivityMutedServices`. See the [online browser-tabs guide](https://github.com/fernandodamaso/smart-omarchy-dock/blob/370585ccfaed98f1d04954d8598a868aef80a087/docs/browser-tabs.md); it is not part of the offline CLI documentation bundle. |
| `position` | `"bottom"` | Classic dock edge; the classic dock renders on the bottom only and the left vertical presentation is the sidebar mode. Drag empty dock background left to switch to the sidebar, or empty sidebar background down to return. Legacy left, right and top read as bottom. |
| `fullLength` | `false` | Boolean; extend along the available edge. |
| `reserveSpace` | `true` | Boolean; effective false while autoHide is enabled, without erasing this request. |
| `autoHide` | `false` | Boolean; existing edge-reveal auto-hide, not a new hide-mode enum. |
| `clickAction` | `"focus-or-launch"` | String: none, minimize-restore, previews, close, focus-or-launch. Close is destructive-on-use. |
| `middleClickAction` | `"none"` | Same canonical action vocabulary as clickAction. |
| `scrollAction` | `"none"` | String: none or cycle-windows. |
| `controlCommand` | `"omarchy-menu toggle apps"` | Nonempty string; executable-on-use launcher configuration, never executed by validation. |
| `sortByWorkspace` | `false` | Boolean; flat-layout workspace sorting; closed pins remain first. |
| `workspaceLayout` | `"flat"` | String: flat or grouped. Grouped cards render on the bottom dock only. |
| `workspaceMonitorScope` | `"all"` | String: all or current-monitor; grouped cards only. |
| `workspaceMonitorOrder` | `[]` | Exact case-sensitive connector-name array. Empty uses automatic physical x/y order; configured connected monitors lead, unlisted connected monitors append automatically, and disconnected names remain saved for reconnect. Classic grouped/all and global sidebar presentation; never reconfigures Hyprland monitors. |
| `groupWindows` | `false` | Deprecated/inactive compatibility Boolean. Stored legacy `true` is preserved on read and unrelated writes but never changes presentation; new attempts to enable it are rejected. |
| `workspaceGroups` | `[]` | Strict opt-in `{desktopId, workspace}` pairs. Workspace identities are canonical `id:N` or safe `name:N`; duplicate pairs and ambiguous/special identities are rejected atomically. |
| `interfaceAnimationsEnabled` | `true` | Boolean; interface transitions, not every compositor animation or attention nudge. |
| `windowScope` | `"all"` | String: all, workspace, monitor, workspace-monitor; flat-layout running-window filtering. |
| `showUrgentOutsideScope` | `true` | Boolean; genuinely urgent windows may bypass flat window scope; hidden apps remain hidden. |
| `attentionBadgesEnabled` | `true` | Boolean; gates attention indicators without installing a notification daemon. |
| `urgentWindowAnimationEnabled` | `true` | Boolean; existing bounded attention motion, also gated by attentionBadgesEnabled in rendering. |
| `launcherBadgeMode` | `"automatic"` | String: automatic or dots-only. Uses an already-available provider; does not start/install one. |
| `browserProfileBadgesEnabled` | `true` | Boolean; per-window browser profile corner badges (photo or initial) from the browser-profile provider. No provider or DevTools endpoint means no badges; the setting installs nothing. |
| `browserActivityMutedServices` | `[]` | Safe service ID array (`gmail`, `whatsapp`, …). Muted rows stay visible and openable but are excluded from Chrome activity header and dock badge totals; retained by preference reset. |
| `hiddenApplications` | `[]` | Safe desktop ID array with no new canonical duplicates; independent of pins and retained by preference reset. |
| `pinned` | `["org.gnome.Nautilus","com.google.Chrome","com.mitchellh.ghostty","code","obsidian","chatgpt"]` | Ordered safe desktop ID array, including unavailable/hidden apps; no new canonical duplicates; retained by preference reset. |

## Requested, effective and rendered

Requested settings retain accepted intent: `hoverGlowOpacity: 0.72` projects to 0.70, `hoverGlowRadius: 28` to 30, and `backgroundOpacity: 0.88` to 0.90. A requested grouped layout survives moving to a vertical edge; effective layout becomes flat and effective workspaceMonitorScope becomes all. Auto-hide makes effective reserveSpace false without rewriting the requested value. New pointer writes require canonical values; stored legacy `focus`/`launch` aliases read effectively as `focus-or-launch` without an unrelated rewrite. Stored legacy `groupWindows: true` remains visible in requested readback but its effective value is always false; no startup rewrite or automatic local-group migration occurs. Use `workspaceGroups` or the context-menu **Group Windows** action instead.

`workspaceMonitorOrder` is normalized only for effective/rendered use. Missing or malformed legacy stored values read effectively as `[]` without startup rewrite; requested readback still exposes the stored bytes so an agent can decide whether to repair them. New writes are atomic: connector entries must be trimmed nonempty strings with no control characters or exact duplicates. Connector matching is case-sensitive, and valid virtual connector names are allowed.

Effective output is a headless projection, not complete rendered truth. Theme-owned/token colors and theme-owned border width are null with a warning. The normalized urgentWindowAnimationEnabled flag does not by itself report badge-gated animation eligibility; the renderer also requires attentionBadgesEnabled and eligible live attention. Numeric launcher counts alone do not trigger motion. Standalone remains dot-only without the plugin-owned provider. Report these dependencies rather than inventing a fully resolved effective value.

Colors accept an empty string, `#RRGGBB`, Qt **`#AARRGGBB`** (alpha first), or a syntactically valid symbolic token. Pair each color with its Enabled flag in one atomic patch. Disabling only that flag restores inheritance without discarding the stored override. An empty override inherits the theme. Unknown symbolic tokens are retained and use renderer fallback rather than being silently deleted; the CLI does not certify that a token exists in the installed theme.

Existing token families include:

```text
@background @foreground @accent @muted @urgent
@bar.background @bar.text @bar.active
@popups.background @popups.text @popups.border
@tooltip.background @tooltip.text @tooltip.border
@menu.background @menu.text @menu.border
@menu.selected-background @menu.selected-text @menu.selected-border
@notifications.background @notifications.text @notifications.border @notifications.countdown
```

Colors remain live theme bindings after Settings removal. Custom background alpha is multiplied by backgroundOpacity. Workspace-number badges inherit accent/white when their overrides are disabled. Image artwork is a separate local-file mapping, not a color token; custom images are not tinted.

## Layout, windows and identity

Workspace groups are opt-in per canonical application/workspace pair and never span workspaces. A saved pair survives empty workspaces and restart, new arrivals join automatically, moved windows follow the destination policy, minimized windows retain membership through their recorded origin, and unresolved/special workspace membership remains individual. Browser profile metadata does not create a second grouping dimension.

Workspace cards and window filtering are different features. Grouped cards organize all matching workspace members using workspaceMonitorScope; flat layout retains windowScope, sortByWorkspace and urgent-outside-scope filtering. Do not move a vertical dock without authorization merely to make cards visible. In flat layout, workspace scope uses the focused monitor's active workspace, monitor scope uses each dock's screen, and combined scope requires both. Closed pinned launchers remain visible; explicitly hidden applications remain hidden. Minimized origins and transient location fallbacks remain owned by the shared window controller.

In grouped `workspaceMonitorScope: all`, monitor sections use `workspaceMonitorOrder`. With `[]`, connected monitors with usable finite positions are sorted numerically by x then y, followed by deterministic connector/identity ties; monitors without usable positions follow positioned monitors. A saved order such as `["HDMI-A-1","DP-1"]` puts those connected connectors first and appends other connected monitors using the same automatic geometry order. A disconnected listed connector is not rendered but stays saved and resumes its configured slot after reconnect. This setting never dispatches monitor/workspace moves and has no visual effect in flat or `current-monitor` layouts. Workspace/application presentation identities and global badge traversal remain independent from section order.

Grouped/all renders those ordered monitor sections inline in the existing single horizontal workspace viewport. A small display glyph and bounded plain-text monitor label appear only before the section's first present workspace card. The compact label prefers the live monitor model, falls back to description, connector/name and then `Monitor N`, elides long text, and exposes the full description/connector through tooltip and accessibility text. Duplicate display descriptions remain separate because section identity is the canonical monitor identity. The label/separator is informational only: it does not take keyboard focus, activate workspaces, or become a drag/drop surface. `current-monitor` keeps the existing unprefixed card appearance.

Each connected monitor may have one active workspace card simultaneously. The workspace on Hyprland's globally focused monitor remains the unique primary workspace used for automatic reveal and global badge/preview traversal. Focus-only monitor changes update the informational prefix brightness and primary reveal without changing monitor-section order or keyed workspace/application identities. Closed global launchers render once before all sections; **Other windows** renders once after them. When a first card exits or transfers monitors, the next present card acquires the prefix while the keyed card/app delegates are retained.

Workspace-header activation still uses the central workspace-on-monitor route: clicking a grouped header pulls that workspace onto the clicked dock monitor and focuses it. A plain click on a window icon inside a workspace card focuses the exact window in place; Ctrl+left click explicitly pulls the card workspace to the clicked dock monitor before focusing it. The shared controller retains the FDM-942/FDM-943 workspace-monitor pin enforcement hooks for callers that establish a pin, though the current workspace header has no pin menu. Plain app-icon activation already focuses in place. FDM-949 remains the full-host qualification reference.

Dragging a grouped workspace header to another monitor's SmartDock moves that workspace without sending a focus command. The source must already be visible; an auto-hidden destination reveals only after the pointer reaches its normal reveal strip, and the drop is accepted only over the visible dock background. Release elsewhere, return to the source dock, Escape, invalidation, or a session pin cancels without a command. In `current-monitor` the card transfers from the source dock to the destination; in `all` every dock mirrors its transfer between monitor sections. This does not change app reordering, window-to-card dragging, workspace ordering, settings, schema, or CLI.

Workspace drag/drop continues to scan the one global workspace-card repeater and map the pointer into the actual `DockWorkspaceGroup` card. Monitor labels, separators, prefix gaps, navigation controls, clipped pixels, **Other windows** and ordinary gaps are not targets. Existing remote, empty and named workspace resolution stays owned by the shared window controller; topology changes during a frozen drag still revalidate the live destination rather than trusting wrapper geometry.

Right click remains the context menu. Existing modifier precedence, grouped close/minimize/restore and wheel rules remain unchanged. Pinning does not show a hidden app; hiding does not unpin/close it; unpinning does not hide a running app. Restore and move use exact host-discovered IDs and preserve unrelated order, including unavailable entries. Application display-name queries are discovery, not mutation identities.

Icon overrides are app-wide and SmartDock-only. Set/reset changes one latest-map entry, including for an unavailable safe identity, without changing desktop files, launch commands, grouping or screenshots. The local PNG/SVG is referenced in place. Use explicit reload after same-path byte replacement. Missing/corrupt artwork retains the mapping and uses the bounded original/generic/bundled-glyph fallback. All CLI icon acknowledgments retain `renderVerified: false`.

Window icon overrides are a separate ordered rule collection keyed by normalized raw
Wayland `(appId, titlePattern)`. Only `*` is wildcard syntax; matching is
case-insensitive and full-title, first match wins, patterns are trimmed and limited
to 1–200 characters with no control characters. Rules survive restarts and apply to
all matching current/future windows. Grouped application/workspace pairs are
partitioned into distinct matched-rule and unmatched subsets; ungrouped windows keep
their exact-window identity. Different workspaces never merge. Sidebar keeps its
existing per-window hierarchy and only receives the matched artwork.

Renderer precedence is window rule → browser-profile override → app-wide override →
desktop icon → generic icon → bundled glyph. Reset removes only the exact rule and
may expose another rule or fallback. A source-only edit keeps stable rule/presentation
identity; changing the pattern may change identity. Source A→B propagation and
same-source byte reload are distinct: the latter advances the shared artwork revision
without a redundant settings write. Malformed/duplicate collections are rejected
unchanged; no migration or partial repair is attempted.

## Reset, preservation and executable settings

`config reset --preferences` preserves pinned, hiddenApplications, browserActivityMutedServices, iconOverrides, margin and unknown extension keys; **controlCommand is reset** along with other preferences. `workspaceMonitorOrder` and `workspaceGroups` are ordinary preferences, so preference reset restores automatic monitor ordering and clears local grouping pairs; `config reset workspaceMonitorOrder` and `config reset workspaceGroups` reset only their exact keys. Do not perform a broad reset for a narrow request.

Existing unknown keys and untouched legacy values survive minimal mutations. New unknown keys are rejected. An explicit array/object patch replaces that whole key, not a deep merge. Prefer `apps`/`icons` commands for individual membership/order/artwork changes and touched-key rollback after fresh readback.

`controlCommand` is executable configuration: store only an intentionally chosen command, quote it literally, and never run it merely to check validity. The existing launcher action can execute it later. Pointer `close` can close every live member of an application group when used. Changes to either require explicit intent; schema reads, dry runs and metadata validation do not execute them.

## Sidebar presentation (SB-02 + SB-03 source foundation)

Classic remains the default. `presentationMode: "sidebar"` maps mirrored panels on
connected screens (or one panel when `sidebarMonitor` names a connected connector),
while classic preferences remain requested data and return unchanged on switching
back. Empty `sidebarMonitor` means every connected monitor; a set connector maps
only that output. Disconnected names remain saved and fall back to all connected
screens. Placement does not filter the window inventory.

Sidebar effective output uses all monitors, structural workspace-local application
groups, persistent reservation, icons capped at 32, and no previews or auto-hide.
Classic click/middle-click/scroll actions are reported as `null` (inactive).
The `presentation` diagnostic lists inactive classic settings, primary connector,
full `screens` list, effective persistent width and whether that geometry can map.
These are source projections, not proof that the compositor mapped a surface. No
screen means zero width and `mapped: false`. Width uses unreserved logical screen
geometry. Each output reserves its own exclusive zone from its clamped width.

The seven sidebar settings support the existing typed set/apply/reset/schema/get
commands. Width writes accept integers 240–480; the runtime may clamp the effective
width below 240 on narrow screens without rewriting the requested value. The
expanded resize handle lives inside the reserved width. Pointer motion changes only
temporary effective geometry; a changed release submits one `sidebarExpandedWidth`
intent. No-op release and cancellation write nothing. Collapsing a panel submits
only `sidebarCollapsedByMonitor` for that connector, preserves expanded width and
retains session-only app folds. Global `sidebarCollapsed` remains the default for
monitors without an override.
Unknown keys, pins, artwork, hidden apps and provider preferences survive unrelated
changes. Empty `sidebarCollapsedByMonitor` follows `sidebarCollapsed` on every
output; a connector key overrides only that panel.

Gesture commits use the existing sole writer. A stale captured field is rejected
rather than replayed; an accepted write may report persistence pending without
becoming a rejected intent. Persistence failure keeps the accepted live value and
retry persists the latest complete host snapshot. See `SIDEBAR_RESIZE.md` for the
exact geometry, cancellation, writer-count and deferred runtime contracts.

This is an **unreleased Draft foundation**, not integrated sidebar acceptance.
SB-03 owns resize gestures, SB-04 owns full navigation/menus/keyboard/drag,
SB-05 owns the internal provider lifecycle and FDM-973 moves Widget cards into the
hierarchy's shared scroll. Local compositor qualification follows in FDM-974 after
the reusable UI-kit slice. See the source-only `docs/SIDEBAR.md` contract.

`sidebarWidgets` uses the internal source registry, currently empty in production.
Runtime schema `registeredIds` is authoritative for new writes. Unknown imports are
never executed; requested readback retains them and `data.presentation.widgets`
reports unavailable state. `config get --effective` lists only registered IDs.
The normal Widget section has no independent footer cap/scrollbar and consumes zero
height when no Widgets are enabled; Add/Manage remains available in expanded mode.
`sidebarWidgetCollapsed` stores body state without enabling providers. These
controls do not change stock topbar services. Source contract:
`docs/SIDEBAR_WIDGETS.md`.
