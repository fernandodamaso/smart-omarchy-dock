# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Shipped the CLI command/JSON/error reference, all 41 declared setting defaults
  and dependencies, and agent recipes for minimal patches, themes, calmer motion,
  workspace cards, application restoration/order and per-app icon set/reload/reset.
- Added executable documentation checks through the existing CLI and production
  host/model harness, including preservation, dry runs, effective projections,
  parser/schema consistency, Unicode artwork URLs and offline installation.
- Included linked reference, inventory and local-runbook documents beside the
  installed agent guide without adding a runtime, test framework or CI workflow.
- Added the migration plan and exact-SHA FDM-920/FDM-885 joint local runbook with
  isolation, touched-state restoration and explicit not-yet-verified runtime gates.

### Changed

- Removed the graphical Dock Settings page, its menu route, temporary preference
  previews, exclusive controls and editor-only helpers. Configuration and icon
  editing now use `smartdock config`, `smartdock apps` and `smartdock icons`.
- Retained ordinary window previews, the app picker, dock menus, auto-hide,
  pinned-app dragging, workspace/window actions, Trash and live theme bindings.
- Preserved existing configuration, application identities, pin order, hidden
  membership and custom icons through the existing host-owned settings writer.
  Restore hidden applications with `smartdock apps show ID` or `apps show --all`.
- Updated active configuration instructions and split mixed regression suites so
  runtime behavior remains covered without depending on removed UI components.
- **Breaking launcher change:** bare `smartdock` shows help; unrecognized leading
  arguments no longer implicitly launch Quickshell. Replace invocations such as
  `smartdock --no-color` with `smartdock launch --no-color`. The explicit
  `--daemonize` and `-d` lifecycle aliases remain supported.
- **Source configuration migration:** `./scripts/run` now defaults to
  `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/smartdock/dock.json`, not the checkout's
  `config/dock.json`. `SMARTDOCK_CONFIG` still selects an explicit configuration.
  Existing source-only customizations are not copied over user state automatically;
  preserve a separate copy outside the checkout and select it explicitly. Use an
  isolated config/display for source qualification, not a second production dock.

### Fixed

- Source-run configuration saves no longer overwrite the bundled defaults used
  by single-key and preference resets after restart.
- New bulk pin/hidden-ID patches reject surrounding whitespace instead of saving
  identities that CLI discovery and dock rendering resolve differently. Untouched
  legacy settings are preserved.
- Drag reordering uses the same legacy-preserving move intent as the CLI,
  retaining duplicate/unavailable legacy pins, hidden membership, other ordering
  and the existing forward/backward drop semantics. Bulk replacement stays strict.
- Removed the obsolete local dropdown fixture and extended both removal audits
  to local tests. The FDM-858 UI audit is explicitly historical and superseded.

The CLI-first migration remains an unreleased candidate. Remote checks do not
replace the final Omarchy focus, auto-hide, FileView and image/cache qualification.
Historical entries below describe earlier versions and are not current UI routes.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Updated FDM-814 attention motion so SNI `NeedsAttention`, critical local
  notification attention, and Hyprland urgency share the bounded
  `0 -> 5 -> 0 -> 3 -> 0` nudge. Active attention can receive reminders no more
  than once every three seconds; launcher counts alone remain static while
  counts with attention remain eligible.
- Reorganized Dock Settings into icon-led Icons, Hover effect, Dock surface,
  Layout, and Behavior cards matching the approved compact layout.
- Added progressive Theme default, Omarchy token, custom hex, and custom border
  width controls while preserving the existing JSON schema.
- Added a collapsible launcher section and fixed Reset/Close footer.
- Added theme-tinted Lucide section and action icons using Omarchy accent and
  urgent tokens.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Established SmartDock for Omarchy as an independently released GitHub fork
  distributed from the SmartDock repository.
- Assigned the public Omarchy plugin ID `io.github.fernandodamaso.smartdock`.
- Preserved user configuration in `~/.config/smartdock/dock.json` across Git
  migration and plugin updates.

## 1.1.1-custom.18 - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Added a theme-aware Dock Settings panel with live previews, persistent controls, and reset-to-defaults support.
- Added a dynamic Trash utility with open, item-count, empty/full icon, and confirmed Empty Trash actions.
- Added compact workspace navigation at the trailing edge using the same visibility rule as the configured Omarchy workspace widget.
- Added independent opt-in dock background color, border color, and border width overrides in Dock Settings.
- Added clickable alpha-aware color swatches beside the background and border hex fields.
- Added ready-to-choose Omarchy theme-token presets for dock background and border colors; symbolic selections follow theme changes.
- Added live color squares to each theme-token selector option and its selected-value trigger.
- Added Dock Settings controls for enabling hover glow and adjusting its intensity and radius.

### Changed

- Renamed the user-facing dock branding to **SmartDock for Omarchy** while
  preserving the existing plugin ID, commands, configuration path, and
  internal Hyprland workspace namespace for compatibility.
- Replaced the first dock item's grid artwork with a sliders-style controls icon.
- Split the dock into leading controls, centered applications, and trailing utilities so full-length and vertical layouts remain organized.
- Kept dock-wide settings, application pinning, and auto-hide actions exclusively in the controls icon menu.
- Tied reserved screen space to visibility so the dock reserves a dock-sized area only while auto-hide is disabled; the Reserve space control is disabled while auto-hide is enabled.
- Added themed glyphs to the Dock Settings, Add Application, and Auto-Hide actions.
- Colorized the symbolic Trash icon with white/accent states and aligned workspace controls to the same icon centerline at every dock edge.
- Made the idle Trash glyph fully opaque white; it still changes to the theme accent while hovered.
- Reworked Dock Settings into a responsive 980 px two-column layout so desktop screens avoid vertical scrolling.
- Bundled Lucide `trash-2` artwork and matching Lucide icons for dock and window context-menu actions.
- Clicking the controls icon now opens its menu; the menu's **Open App Launcher** action runs the configured launcher command.
- Centered application, control, Trash, and workspace icons symmetrically on every dock edge.
- Moved application, controls, and Trash hover labels to popup-backed tooltips so long names remain visible at dock edges.
- Replaced hover fill-and-border tiles with a soft theme-accent glow behind each magnified icon.
- Forced the color picker to use an in-overlay Quick implementation so GTK's native
  color window cannot appear behind Dock Settings.
- Kept the dock's edge input strip available while Dock Settings is open, so hover
  magnification and glow previews remain visible during live edits.
- Released Hyprland's compositor-wide exclusive pointer routing after the settings
  surface acquires keyboard focus, restoring dock hover events reliably.

## 1.1.1-custom.17 - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Removed the workspace badge border and restored white workspace numbers without changing the separate hover tooltip styling.

## 1.1.1-custom.16 - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Removed borders from dock tooltips and made tooltip labels white for clearer contrast.

## 1.1.1-custom.15 - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Made workspace number badges opaque and accent-colored so they remain visible over application icons.

## 1.1.1-custom.14 - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Replaced dock, menu, picker, tooltip, badge, border, radius, typography, and hover styling with Omarchy theme tokens.
- Kept `backgroundOpacity` as a user-controlled multiplier on the active theme surface alpha.
- Made standalone launches expose the same Omarchy QML modules without modifying `/usr/share/omarchy`.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Optional auto-hide with animated screen-edge reveal, configurable through `autoHide` or the dock context menu.

### Fixed

- Keep the revealed dock's full interaction area clickable and allow more time to move from the screen edge to an icon.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Drag-to-reorder pinned applications with automatic config persistence.
- Right-click actions to open a new window or close a running application.
- Fuzzy application picker and right-click actions for pinning or unpinning apps.
- Configurable dock background transparency through `backgroundOpacity`.

### Fixed

- Focus existing browser-based web apps instead of launching duplicate windows.
